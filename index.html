            <h2>From the Begining till now</h2>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a person that has been raised in the wester hemisphere.
                I tell myself i am special because i have a very different perspective then most. Born in Mexico
                lived in Compton California, and raised in the bible belt AKA. Chattanooga Tn. They say i am well rounded like a
                doughnut.
                this upbringing has lead me to look at everything i do differently. I like to step out of my boundaries.
                I am brand new at web developing so that means my mind has yet to be corrupted. I am the right person to be molded
                into anything that is needed. what i lack in experience i make up for in potential and hard work ethic.
